## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a student, I constantly struggled with organizing questions from messy PDFs. This project was born out of that frustration — with the goal of helping myself and others study more effectively.

I built this from scratch while learning web development, and it taught me a lot about problem-solving, design, and the power of collaboration. 🙌
